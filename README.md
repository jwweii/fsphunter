# fsphunter

This program was developed to locate the genome coordinates by giving amino acid sequences of neoantigens derived from frameshift mutations. 
The idea of this program is 


To pull down the Docker image, run the following command in your terminal:  
`docker run -it --rm jwweii/fsphunter:"ver6" /bin/bash -c "cd /frameshift_project/ && /bin/bash"`.     

For users on WashU Compute1-RIS server:  
`LSF_DOCKER_PRESERVE_ENVIRONMENT=false bsub -G compute-PI_NAME -Is -q general-interactive -a 'docker(jwweii/fsphunter:ver5)' /bin/bash -c "cd ../../frameshift_project/ && /bin/bash"`.   
The version of this docker image is different from that for the use in a usual terminal because there seems to be a firewall in Compute1-RIS clusters, where AnnitationHub, a R package, cannot normally work. In this version, the required R object and SQLite file were preloaded in the docker image.
